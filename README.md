  # Overall Sales Performance

    Total Sales Amount: 29.36M

    Total Product Cost: 17.28M

    Total Orders: 60K

    Profit: 12.08M (Sales - Product Cost), indicating a good profit margin.

  # Month-wise Sales Trends

     Sales peak in September (2.53M) and October (2.91M), suggesting seasonal demand.

     The lowest sales month is January (1.68M), potentially indicating a post-holiday sales dip.

     A steady upward trend is observed after February, with sales peaking in Q4.

  # Quarter-wise Sales Distribution

     Q4 (31%) contributes the most revenue (9.11M).

     Q3 (24%) and Q2 (26%) show balanced sales trends.

     Q1 (19%) has the lowest sales, possibly due to slow business activity in the first quarter.

  # Year-wise Sales Trends

     Sales peaked in 2013 (16.4M), with the highest profitability.

     2011 and 2012 show steady growth, while 2010 had the lowest sales (7.1M).

     2014 data is incomplete or missing, suggesting data collection stopped or a business shift occurred.

  # Sales Amount vs. Product Cost (Yearly)

     2013 had the highest sales (16.4M) and the highest cost (9.6M), meaning higher expenses but also higher revenue.

     2012 had lower sales (5.8M) and lower costs (3.4M), indicating a less profitable year.

     Profitability increased significantly over the years, showing a positive business trend.

  # Key Takeaways & Recommendations

     ✔ Q4 (October-December) drives the highest sales, so marketing and promotions should be focused here.
     
     ✔ Q1 sales are lower, suggesting a need for off-season promotions or discounts.
     
    ✔ 2013 was the best year for sales, and understanding the factors behind its success could help replicate growth.
    
     ✔ Product cost management is key since high costs in some years reduced profitability.
     
     ✔ Increasing sales in slow months like January & February could improve revenue stability
